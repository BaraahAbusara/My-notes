I am Bara√°h Abusara , An architect and a **very passionate programmer**.  
Thant might sounds weird to you I know ..  
But after knowing more about programming using c++ language I couldn't leave it.  
I started my journey with *Problem solving ,Data structures and algorithms* then participated in many *problem solving contests* to decide to go for software development career, and **here I am**.   

## My Readings  

In [Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in 15 minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/) article , I found very useful advice to have a good developer mindset, which can be summarised into group of points :

+ Keep in mind that the goal of writing codes is **to help the users** not to show your intellegence so keep your code *readable* and *understandable*.  
+ **understand the project you are working on very well**. 
+ A complex code doesn't necessarily make a useful application so take it easy and keep your code less complex as possible. 
+ You are not only helping users but also helping your teammates to keep the project helpful as long as possible , and to do so **keep your code *readable* and *understandable***.
+ When you think of editing or adding features to your project keep in mind that **desirability of a feature = Value of it for users /Effort of adding it** . 
+ when you face a problem :  
    + understand it well and take your time analyzing it.
    + Plan for the solution by dividing the problems into smaller ones for easier solving.
    + solve them and connect the dots.
+ Do not look for perfiction , **Start small, improve it, then extend.**
+ **work for now** , not for future predictions or assumptions. 
+ If you can use an existing wheel, **do not reinvent it**. 
+ Play it smart developer, **if you can automate  part of your work, do it** 
+ test your code **as parts** not as whole by putting all input cases possible, do not fix a bug based on assumptions; **prove it then fix it**.
+ do your best not to rewrite your code ,**refactor it**. 
+ let the code says *what* it does, and comments say *why* you did it that way.
+ Buy your freedom and **Don't depend on extrnal technologies as much as you can**. 
+ **keep developing yourself**, read more and learn more.
+ **know when to quit and ask for help**, *try everything* you thought of until you have no more ideas , then *search online* ,if you couldn't find a solution *ask for help*.

### In conclusion   
Keep in mind that you are working in a team for helping users for a better life, things never been about your abilities , so stay professional, help everyone and **no need to show off.**
